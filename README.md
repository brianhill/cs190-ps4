CS 190 [Course Home Page]( http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/classes/CS190_S16/index.html )

Due: Thursday, March 3rd, 2016.

## Reading for this Problem Set

* In the [Intermediate Swift GitHub Repository](https://github.com/brianhill/intermediate-swift) study the two playgrounds numbered 3_1 and 3_2.
* The above two playgrounds follow _and_ _simplify_ _to_ _an_ _intermediate_ _level_, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of [Advanced Swift]( https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/ ), by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Although the above two playground stand on their own, they could be used with Eidhof and Velocity in hand to take your understanding to an advanced level.

## Directions for this Problem Set

* Fork this repo and make a local copy.
* Open the PS4 playground. Adjust Xcode so that it shows the output of the unit tests.
* Follow the directions in Parts 1, 2 and 3.
* When the unit tests pass, commit your changes to your local repo and then push them to your fork.
